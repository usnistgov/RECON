// Dictionary RECON.dic

// Derived from SCOWL spelling dictionaries developed by Kevin Atkinson
//  available from http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/
// the derivation used a dictionary of irregular nouns and verbs
// and a heuristic application of English orthography rules for regular nouns and verbs

// Note:  The dictionary is mostly in descending order by word length
// this has the beneficial effect of putting the less common words deeper 
// into the indexing buckets used by the RECON word recognition process
// and the more common words on the top

// in this version, only verbs and nouns are distinguished from words that have
// only a single form.  In particular, adjectives and comparative forms are not marked.
