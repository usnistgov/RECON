CLIF Generation Notes

Simple Form corresponds to a relation of the form: (verb verbRole1 ... verbRoleN)
where the roles have a fixed ordering chosen for the CLIF version of the verb.

Each verbRole is the representative of a RolePhrase, which is either a constant or a variable.
Role Phrases can be:

- Instance:  LexicalInstance and ProperName are constants, 
  ExtentConcept and Nominalization are unitary variables assigned to their formulations

- RoleNoun: corresponds to a pre-defined variable -- the role in the defined relation
  Quantifiers 'the' is all that makes sense, and it is ignored.

- Pronoun: corresponds to an existing Variable, via a reference to another RolePhrase that defines it.
  Quantifiers:  all, some, none, n, at least n, at most n "of them" or "of which"
  These refer to instances of the referent role that satisfy the relation in which the referent role appears.
  That is, these quantifiers create a set from that relation and refer to elements of that set.
  Equivalently, these quantifiers 

- TypeNoun: corresponds to a variable
  no Quantifier -> use 'all'
  Quantifier 'the' without a qualifier makes it a reference to another RolePhrase (and its variable)
  Quantifier an -> new variable, existential quant
  Quantifier 'the' with qualifier -> new variable, unitary
  Quantifier 'all' -> new variable, universal quant
  Quantifier 'no' -> new variable, universal quant, negates verb (or not exists x verb)  -- transform parse
  Quantifier 'some': treat as 'an' until we see a counterexample.
  Quantifier 'at least 1' -> new variable, existential quant
  Quantifier 'at most 1' -> new variable, universal quant, uniqueness rule (problematic in antecedent)
  Quantifier 'exactly 1' -> new variable, existential quant, uniqueness rule
  Quantifiers involving 'n' refer to sets, where the set has the at least, at most, exactly variable, as above
   the set has a cardinality constraint (and-ed) and a universal member variable has set membership and the role constraints, and is the role phrase variable. 

  Modifier 'the same' refers to the variable that is the relative; possible new variable w equality anded in?
  Modifier 'the other' without a qualifier is a reference to a variable introduced as 'other'
  Modifier 'the other' with a qualifier -> new variable, unitary, inequality to relative is qualifier
  Modifier 'other' -> new variable, universal, inequality to relative is qualifier, quantification per Quantifier above, no Quantifier is 'all'
  Modifier adjectives become qualifiers using their verb form
  Modifier 'different' always refers to a set and is usually ignored, that is, '3 shipments' and '3 different shipments' have the same meaning.
  Modifier 'a different' is treated as 'an other' by the parser (we could move that interpretation to code generation).
  
 Qualifiers (and converted Modifiers) are additional simple forms.
 Qualifiers used with existential quantification of the Role variable are And-ed with the primary form
 Qualifiers used with universal quantification of the Role variable are If antecedents of the primary form.

- PropertyNoun is a variable
  'the' PropertyNoun without domain refers to an existing RoleVariable representing the same Property
  PropertyNoun with domain -> new variable with qualifier for its relationship to the domain RolePhrase
    Quantifiers and Modifiers as above.
