     when preceded by 'the', it is a reference to a previous occurrence of the property term

noun term is a term token
   when preceded by 'the' it is a reference to a previous occurrence of the noun term
   or a previous occurrence of a property term homograph, whichever occurs 'first'.

When seeking a previous occurrence, we use the most recent previous occurrence of the term, working backward from the current node.  The first find is considered successful.
If the parse of that node has a referent, then this occurrence is another reference to that referent.
If the parse of the matching node has no referent, then this occurrence is a reference to that parse.

Linking anaphor references are already captured.
